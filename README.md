### Assignment guidelines
Create a simple page showing a search input field. When the user types in a title of the movie, fetch the list of results from this APILinks to an external site. and show them in the DOM. When you are done, add support for multiple results to your application - Using the API's parameter `s` instead of `t` allows us to get a list of movies based on a search query. Show the new result format in a list of movies in the DOM.
- Bonus points if you are able to add a checkbox or a dropdown concerning the type of release (valid types are: movie, series, episode). Add support for this new query parameter to your API call.
